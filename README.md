# Caesar Cipher

Ceasar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest encoding techniques. A Ceasar Cipher works by shifting the alphabet by a set number of letters down the alphabet.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To be able to run the program, you need to have installed: [ruby-2.4.1](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.1/)

To install it, you can review different options [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)


### Installing & Running the Program

`$ git clone https://github.com/nmcolome/caesar_cipher.git`

Navigate into the project and run the file: 
```
$ cd caesar_cipher/lib
$ ruby caesar_cipher.rb
```

The program should prompt you for a message and a shift value:

```
$ What is the message you want to encode? > Hello world
$ How much do you want to shift? > 5
$ "CZGGJ RJMGY"  #output
```

## Running tests
